I have made a website in which one can get news of different generes in different tabs and it has some features which allow users
to directly jump from genre to other without again going to webpage. The website has a feature using which users can recommend anything to us 
and also send some news which is left uncovered through google forms along with his/her contact information so that
we can contact him/her for the same.
News boxes have images of fixed width and height which gives an idea of what nesw is all about, a heading line which
tells the main headline of the news and body in which the news is descibed well.
News boxes have fixed maximum height so if news content is more than that than scroll bar is enabled which allows
 user to scroll over and read whole news.
